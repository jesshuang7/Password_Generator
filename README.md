## About the Project:
The focus of this project was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The password must be between 8-128 characters and must include at least one chractert type -- lower/upper case letters, numbers, or special characters. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
